# Portfolio Alpha

This was my first attempt at building a personal portfolio. It's a raw version where I explored layout ideas, experimented with colors and typography, and tried to figure out what I wanted to say about myself.

## Highlights
- Initial concept and structure
- Pure HTML/CSS with minimal interactivity
- Experimental layout choices

> Think of this version as the sketchbook phase â€” messy but full of potential.
